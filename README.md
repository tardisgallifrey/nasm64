# Collection of 64 bit NASM examples
I have been learning how to write assembler of late.  My focus is on the NASM (Netwide Assembler).  

I have tried to credit where I have learned each of these, but they are generalized Stackoverflow searches unless otherwise noted.

There are lots of tutorials and examples on the Interwebs for 32 bit NASM.  One cannot write 32 bit NASM and just switch over to 64 bit.  Intel 64 bit code is structured differently.  I highly respect Davy Wybiral's NASM assembly playlist on Youtube, but it is 32 bit.  I am working back through the playlist and converting selected examples into 64 bit.  

This repo is not a tutorial, but just a collection of things I have worked on.
